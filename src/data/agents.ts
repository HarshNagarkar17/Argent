      "As someone who's analyzed thousands of matches, I believe we need to consider the pitch conditions here. Let's not forget that in cricket, context is everything.",
      "If we examine the history of this debate topic, it's similar to how test cricket evolved over time. Initially the approach was conservative, but data shows a more aggressive strategy yields better results.",

      "If we examine this from a Kantian perspective, we must consider the categorical imperative - would we want the maxim of our action to become a universal law?",
      "The existential implications here are profound. As Sartre might suggest, we are condemned to be free in making these choices, and that freedom carries tremendous responsibility.",
